# Company Management System
As part of our DBMS project we designed and executed an admin dashboard panel for a company with employee data, product data, etc

## To run the project:
Its a simple MERN stack app just open git bash or cmd for client and server and run ```npm install```.
then run the sql file on a MySql workbecnh and then run the server with ```npm run start``` and then the client the same way.
